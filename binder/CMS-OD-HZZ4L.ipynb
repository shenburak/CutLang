    "# Higgs to 4 leptons analysis with CMS open data and ADL/CutLang\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an exercise showing a simple analysis exploring the SM Higgs decays to 4 lepton final state, focusing on the e+e-μ+μ- channel.  The analysis aims to explore the kinematics of H --> 4 lepton events and compare them with that of a prominent SM background process with the same final state.\n",
    "  * The signal events consist of H -> 4 lepton events which arise from H --> ZZ --> l+l-l+l- processes (l = e, mu). \n",
    "  * The background events consist of ZZ --> e+e-μ+μ- events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise builds upon the ZZ -> 4 lepton exercise in CMS-OD-ZZ4L.ipynb .\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is performed based on CMS open data MC ntuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis consists of two parts:\n",
    "1. Applying some event selection to the input events and making distributions.  This part is performed using a special language called ADL, and via a software called CutLang that can read and process ADL.\n",
    "2. Drawing plots produced by the previous step.  This part is performed using ROOT (with Python syntax).  ROOT is the main analysis software used at CERN.\n"

    "  * Note that in this exercise we only compare the shapes of the distributions (i.e.: integral of each histogram equals to 1).  In real life, events scale with cross section and luminosity, and there are usually a large number of background events.  Therefore event selections are designed to eliminate as many background events as possible.  Based on what you see in the histograms, if you wanted to eliminate more background events, how would you improve the event selection?  You could try to add these cuts to the ADL description, rerun and check the event numbers in the cutflows."
