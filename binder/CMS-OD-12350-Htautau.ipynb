The analysis aims to explore the kinematics of H --> tau tau and compare them with that of a prominent SM background process with the same final state.\n",

In real life, events scale with cross section and luminosity, and there are usually a large number of background events.  Therefore event selections are designed to eliminate as many background events as possible.  Based on what you see in the histograms, if you wanted to eliminate more background events, how would you improve the event selection?  You could try to add these cuts to the ADL description, rerun and check the event numbers in the cutflows."
