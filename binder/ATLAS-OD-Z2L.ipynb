    "This is an exercise showing a simple analysis exploring the Z -> 2 lepton final state, focusing on the e+e- and μ+μ- channels.  The analysis aims to explore the kinematics of Z --> e+e- OR μ+μ- events.\n",

    "1. Applying some event selection to the input events and making distributions.  This part is performed using a special language called ADL, and via a software called CutLang that can read and process ADL.\n",
    "2. Drawing plots produced by the previous step.  This part is performed using ROOT (with Python syntax).  ROOT is the main analysis software used at CERN.\n"
