 # if you want to re-run by mounting another directory, you should run:
 # docker stop CutLang && docker container rm CutLang
 # and go back step 2 with different path 'docker run -p 8888:8888 -d -v /path/to/you/want/:/src ...'
 # example:
 # docker run -p 8888:8888 -d -v ~/example_work_dir/:/src --name CutLang cutlang/cutlang

```

## <a name="using-cutlang-with-jupyterlab"></a> With JupyterLab
Available on **Linux, macOS, windows**

*In order to run CutLang in JupyterLab, you must first complete the setup from source or with conda or docker.*
### <a name="using-cutlang-with-jupyterlab-setup"></a> Setup
- **You should have completed the CutLang setup and be able to run the CLA command without any problems.**

### <a name="using-cutlang-with-jupyterlab-starting"></a> Starting
*Starts JupyterLab with "ROOT c++ with CutLang" kernel in your current directory*
```bash
  CLA_JupyterLab
  # Jupyter lab will be started, you can use by using the link 127.0.0.1:8888/... in the logs
```

# <a name="running-cutlang"></a> Running CutLang

CutLang is run anywhere using the `CLA` (shell script) or using the `CLA.py` scripts

```bash
 CLA (or CLA.py) [inputrootfile] [inputeventformat] -i [adlfilename.adl] -e [numberofevents]
```
- Input event formats can be: *DELPHES, CMSNANO, LHCO, FCC, ATLASVLL, ATLASOD, CMSOD, VLLBG3 and LVL0 (CutLang internal format)* 
- Number of events is optional.

The output will be saved in `histoOut-[adlfilename].root`.  This ROOT file will have a separate directory for each search region, which contains the relevant histograms and ADL content defining the region. The histogram(s) `cutflow` (and `bincounts`, in case search bins are specified in the region) exist by default.

 conda env create -f scripts/environment.yml # create environment with dependencies
 conda activate CutLang-dev # activate development environment
 source setup.sh
 # if you want, you can run
 # echo "source /path/to/CutLang/setup.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

 # ! Do not add the dockerfile created for the development environment to the git
 docker-compose up
```
Exec the container using (in the another terminal window)
```bash
 docker exec -it cutlang-dev bash
 # then you should run in docker (just first time)
 CLA_recompile # this will run the following in order
 # cd $CUTLANG_PATH/CLA
 # make clean
 # make
